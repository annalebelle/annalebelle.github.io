I am a PhD candidate in the Neuroscience and Behavior Program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Under the mentorship of Dr. Heather Richardson,  my current research focuses on the effects of alcohol binge drinking on oligodendroglial lineage cells and on circuits that undergo myelination during adolescent development. 

As a neuroscientist, I am interested in the neurobiology of resilience. To do this, I aim to understand the cellular and circuit adaptations in response to stress and addiction. Individual differences in adaptations may elucidate differential mechanisms underlying the maladaptive reward and stress behaviors that induce pathological conditions such as alcohol binge drinking, drug addiction, and eating disorders.
