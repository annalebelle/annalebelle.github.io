I am interested in the study of the neuronal mechanisms of maladaptive reward and stress behaviors that induce pathological conditions such as alcohol binge drinking, drug addiction, and eating disorders. Currently I am a PhD candidate in the Neuroscience and Behavior Program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst under the mentorship of Dr. Heather Richardson. My current research focuses on the effects of alcohol binge drinking on circuits that undergo myelination during adolescent development.
