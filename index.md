Pursuing a PhD in Neuroscience, specifically in the study of the neuronal mechanisms of maladaptive reward and stress behaviors that induce pathological conditions such as alcohol binge drinking, drug addiction, and eating disorders. I am interested in addiction and the intersection of stress and reward circuits modulating the transition from substance use to dependence.
