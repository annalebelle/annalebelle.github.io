I am a PhD candidate in the Neuroscience and Behavior Program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Under the mentorship of Dr. Heather Richardson,  my current research focuses on the effects of alcohol binge drinking on oligodendroglial lineage cells and on circuits that undergo myelination during adolescent development. 

As a neuroscientist, I am interested in the cellular mechanisms underlying the maladaptive reward and stress behaviors that induce pathological conditions such as alcohol binge drinking, drug addiction, and eating disorders.
